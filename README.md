Hello there, 
My name is Naisarg Patel and currently, I am pursuing an Advanced Artificial Intelligence course at Centennial College located in Canada. I'am quite a Technophile. My dedication to Machine Learning and programming has been increasing progressively since the day I became familiar with this popular technology and explored its merits and necessity in the near future. 
Also, I am great with Web Development and document-oriented database (MongoDB).
